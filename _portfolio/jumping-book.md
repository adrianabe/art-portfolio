The goal of this project was to combine type and image to create a hand made book on Mark Twain's short story: The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County.

For the front and back cover, I cut a design with an exacto knife out of gold foil and placed this layout over an illustration I printed. I chose maroon and gold as my main colors to illicit a regal feel to the book. The image on the cover is of the main character who rambles about different topics throughout the story.

In the inside of the book, I chose a soft, fabric-like material to add interest and variety in the texture of the book.
