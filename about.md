<br>
Yo!<br>
I’m a graphic designer in Minneapolis, and I specialize in creating identities and branding. I’m part of the creative team at Avenue C, where I create logos, ads, newsletters, product packaging and a lot of other great stuff. [Contact me](mailto:adrianab@protonmail.com) if you'd like to work together!

<h2>FUN FACTS</h2>

•  I love Japanese pop culture; the bright colors and anime aesthetics captivates and inspires me.
<br><br>
•  Music is a big influencer in my creative process. I imagine colors, patterns and stories while listening which I, in turn, make into art.
<br>
<br>
•  I like throwing themed tea parties. 
<br>
<br>
•  I collect dolls and toys.
