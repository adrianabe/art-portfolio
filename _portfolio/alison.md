Antisocial Alison is a sticker pack that I illustrated, depicting the comedic facial expressions of a stereotypical American teen. With the help of an iOS and web developer, we put our sticker pack on the App Store and created <a href="https://antisocialalison.com">antisocialalison.com.</a>

The image below is an example of how the stickers can be used. <br>
<div class="alison-screenshots-container">
  ![alsion_screenshot_for_sticker]({{ "/assets/images/screenshotforsticker.png" | relative_url }})
  ![screenshot_for_sticker_2]({{ "/assets/images/screenshotforsticker2.png" | relative_url }})
</div>
<br><br><br>

These are all of the stickers included in the sticker pack.

My ideation sketching style changes every time I draw: sometimes, I draw my idea out in pen, if I need work on the anatomy I sketch with pencil and sometimes I just draw stick figures with the facial expressions I want and then flesh out the character in Illustrator.
