  <p>Amai Surpise is a cute, snack brand that sells healthy, dried fruit snacks for kids. Candy brands generally use bright, popping colors to attract kids into buying their products, so why not apply the same concept to real food? <br><br>The goal of the project is to make the packaging of fruit appealing, so kids can make a healthier choice when selecting food off the shelves in stores. With growing interest in Anime in the West, these magical girl mascots help sell the brand with their own unique look and accessories.</p>
