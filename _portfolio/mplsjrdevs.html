<p>Mpls Jr Devs is a group for aspiring and less experienced software engineers to meet, learn from, and share experiences with one another. I designed the logo, colors theme, and helped decide the design direction of mplsjrdevs.com</p>

<div style="box-shadow: 5px 10px 18px grey;"><img class="full-width" src="/assets/images/MPLSWEBSITE.png"></p></div>
