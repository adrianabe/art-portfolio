Yo! I’m Adriana Belinski and I’m studying graphic design and front-end web development at the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities. I just completed an internship for Public Works Minneapolis in the Street Engineering and Design team, where I would make web updates and graphics. I'm currently on the lookout for graphic design and front-end web development internships for this summer.
