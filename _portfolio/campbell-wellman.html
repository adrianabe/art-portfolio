<div class="portfolio-intro-text-container">
  <p>This real estate company was born out of an idea to provide more of a detailed and bottoms up approach to buying and selling real estate. Compromised of photos of beautiful, high-end homes and elegant typographic and design treatments, their branding communicates its promise of providing clients with excellent communication and luxurious California properties. I created advertisements, business cards, and helped design a brochure alongside another designer.</p>

<h1>BUSINESS CARDS</h1>

<p><img class="full-width" src="/assets/images/CW_Business_Cards.jpg"></p>
<p>Sleek business cards for the realtors. I switched up the placement of the green boxes for visual interest, and I introduced plenty of white space to make the design clean.</p>

I helped create a brochure with the team. My tasks were choosing and editing photos and deciding the typographic treatments and placement of content.
