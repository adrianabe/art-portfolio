# Art Adriana

Art Adriana is a portfolio website built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Workflow

To make changes to the site and view the website locally, you must [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on your machine. Once Jekyll is installed, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project folder in a Terminal window.
2. Run `jekyll serve`. Jekyll will show you an URL you can use to view the local version of the site.
3. While Jekyll is running, open a different terminal window to run other commands related to the project.
