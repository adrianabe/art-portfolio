Edel is a sparkling apple drink that encapsulates the aesthetics surrounding wine for those who donâ€™t drink alcohol. Each individual bottle carries it own unique story of a mythical creature of antiquity.

The illustrations on the bottle are from the Nuremberg Chronicles; a book believed to have the cumilative knowledge of everything people knew about the world in the 14th century. 
<!--
In this project, I rebranded Izze's sparkling apple drink to fit a new target audience: young adults who don't drink alcohol but still want feel upperclass. The idea behind the design was to connect apples with its symbolic roots so I created a design which communicated divinity through its use of gold and white colors, Alphonse Mucha-like decorative swirls, and references to 15th century calligraphy.</p> -->
