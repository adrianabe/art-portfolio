<p>
Edel is a sparkling apple drink that encapsulates the aesthetics surrounding wine for those who don’t drink alcohol. Each individual bottle carries its own unique story of a mythical creature of antiquity with illustrations from the Nuremberg Chronicle.
<!--
In this project, I rebranded Izze's sparkling apple drink to fit a new target audience: young adults who don't drink alcohol but still want feel upperclass. The idea behind the design was to connect apples with its symbolic roots so I created a design which communicated divinity through its use of gold and white colors, Alphonse Mucha-like decorative swirls, and references to 15th century calligraphy.</p> -->

<h1>PERSONA</h1>
<p><img class="full-width" src="/assets/images/edel.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p>Edel’s persona is a 25 year old male who’s a big fan of old architecture and art and loves hanging out with his friends at parties, eating at fancy restaurants when he can, and chilling with some good, retro music.
He is a person who doesn’t drink alcohol either for personal or medical reasons, but still enjoys the aesthetic and wants to fit in.</p>

<h1>MOODBOARD</h1>
<p><img class="full-width" src="/assets/images/edel2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p>Edel’s moodboard consists of Art Nouveau designs and fifteenth-century artwork with an emphasis on the Nuremburg Chronicle: a book consisting of all the cumulative knowledge people in Nuremburg, Germany believed about the world at the time.</p>
<br><br><br>

<h1>IDEATION</h1>
<p><img class="full-width" src="/assets/images/edel3.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p>Early sketches of the Edel logo and bottle design. I used my calligraphy skills to make the wordmark which I then scanned and printed to continue to add extra design elements by splashing ink or creating swirls.</p>
<br><br><br>

<h1>THE BOTTLE</h1>
<p><img class="full-width" src="/assets/images/edel4.jpg"></p>
<p><img class="full-width" src="/assets/images/edel5.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p>The front of the bottle consists of a laser-cut label with a trippy inner design of tumbling buildings that play off
of the idea of distortion caused by alcohol.</p>
<br>
<p>The back of the bottle features a monster from the Nuremberg Chronicle. I researched each individual creature, while also creating some of their back-stories. I colorized some of the black and white images using photoshop.
The type I used is Coquette for a vintage but playful look.</p>
<br><br><br>

<h1>THE PACK</h1>
<br>
<p><img class="full-width" src="/assets/images/edel6.jpg"></p>

<p>The outer packaging continues to play off of the Art Nouveau designs with the swirls and circles encapsulating all the strange creatures.</p>
<br><br><br>

<h1>MYTHICAL MONSTERS PAMPHLET</h1>
<p>

</p>
<br>
<p>Because there are only four bottles, I made sure to include a mini pamphlet with all the creatures which would be placed inside the 4-pack of bottles.</p>
<br><br><br>

<h1>THE FAMILY</h1>
<img class="full-width" src="/assets/images/edelfull.jpg">
<b>
<p>A work of art on the box and every bottle, Edel packaging design provides the consumer with an engaging story behind every creature and also the brand itself. Any adult can walk into a party with an Edel 4-pack and also entertain guests with the beauty of the design.</p>
