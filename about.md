Yo! I’m Adriana Belinski and I’m studying graphic design and web development at the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities. I am an intern at Public Works Minneapolis for the Street Engineering and Design team, where I make web updates and graphics.

This portfolio includes pieces made using Photoshop, Illustrator, my Nikon D7200 camera or acrylic paint, done as class assignments or in my spare time. Some motifs and art styles you may notice in my art includes whimsical themes, flat design, and illustrative work.
