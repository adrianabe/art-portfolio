Mooscoop is a brand of organic kid's yogurt that I created for my Identity and Symbols class. Most kid's yogurt packaging uses over-the-top and outdated motifs like surfing cows or animals with sunglasses. Even organic yogurt brands like Lifeway's Probug yogurt pouches use illustrations of crazy-eyed, neon-colored bugs that can be very off-putting for adults who will likely associate the design with excessive sugar and dangerous chemicals.

In branding Mooscoop, I chose a bright color scheme that still suggests fruit but I used it in a way that would not suggest overly sugary or chemical-ridden. I did this by including recycled paper textures in the business cards and process book and by balancing areas of white space with color to suggest the smaller ratio of fruit to milk in the actual product.

There are two sets of my business cards: one set uses cardboard with a laser cut design to show the brand's environmentally friendly aspect while the white version references the white envelope that the business letter came in. Each business card is the shape of a grocery paper bag and in each set of business cards is a 3d sticker.

<h1>Final Mooscoop Envelope, Business Letter, and Business Cards</h1>

At the inside of the envelope, is my Mooscoop logo sitting in a diamond-shaped block of color. This block of color pours down into a pool of dripping yogurt, balancing the top of the envelope design.

The back of the business letter contains all the colors of my brand in a bright pattern over a dark background while the front of the letter contains only the logo and address for simplicity.

<!--<h1>Business Set Rough Drafts</h1>
![mooscoopdraft1]({{ "/assets/images/mooscoopdraft1.jpg" | relative_url }}){:class="full-width"}
In this draft, I combined three bright colors in a playful, dripping effect to reflect the yogurt the brand would sell.

This design focuses on a mature look with its monochromatic color scheme. The design wasn't chosen because its didn't communicate the dairy aspect of the brand.

This theme focuses on the organic aspect of the brand with its use of earthly colors and "organic" shapes.-->
