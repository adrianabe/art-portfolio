<br>
Yo, my name is Adriana Belinski.
I’m a graphic designer in Minneapolis, and I specialize in creating identities and branding. I’m part of the creative team at Avenue C, where I create logos, ads, newsletters, product packaging and a lot of other great stuff.

<h2>FUN FACTS</h2>

•  I grew up immersed in Japanese pop culture; the bright colors, anime aesthetics, and music has always captivated me and continues to inspire a lot of my art.<br><br>
•  Music is a big influencer in my creative process. I often imagine colors, patterns and stories while listening to music which I, in turn, make into art.<br>
<br>
•  I like throwing themed tea parties. <br><br>
