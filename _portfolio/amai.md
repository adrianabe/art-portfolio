Amai Surprise is a franchise that includes a brand of dried fruit snacks for kids. The goal of the project is to make packaging of fruit as appealing as packaging for candy so kids can make a healthier choice when selecting food off the shelves in stores. Organic food packaging typically tone down the bright colors and switch to more earthly colors for their branding which can incidentally push kids away from eating them.

This brand design is based off of the concept of "magical girls". These are characters from kid's tv shows that have the ability to transform into their super hero selfs and save the day. With the growing interest of anime in the West, branding fruit snacks with magical girls will attract kids from newer generations that are growing familiar with this media.
