  <p>Amai Surpise is a cute, snack brand that sells healthy, dried fruit snacks for kids. Candy brands generally use bright, popping colors to attract kids into buying their products, so why not apply the same concept to real food? <br><br>The goal of the project is to make the packaging of fruit appealing, so kids can make a healthier choice when selecting food off the shelves in stores. With growing interest in Anime in the West, these magical girl mascots help sell the brand with their own unique look and accessories.</p>

<p>The final box will come with a bracelet. Often in magical girl shows, a character has an item such as a necklace or wand that helps them transform into their superhero selves. Our main character Rose tranforms using her special bracelet. The back of the box displays her pre-transformation scene.</p>

<p>Each individual fruit packet comes with a card of the character from the front of the packet. Each card depicts a virtuous action followed by a description of the action.</p>

<p>This is the back of the cards.</p>

<p>This project highlights the Strawberry Mango edition of the Amai Surprise franchise. Hence the box design, card, packet and bracelet have the color scheme of Rose, the Strawberry Mango girl.</p>

<p>The packets and the bracelet fit snugly in the Amai Surprise box, which has a clear top so one can view the contents.</p>

<p>The final box contains three fruit packets, one bracelet, and three cards. (Everything is cushioned by glittering filler.)</p>
