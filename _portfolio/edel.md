In this project, I rebranded Izze's sparkling apple drink to fit a new target audience: young adults who don't drink alcohol but still want feel upperclass. The idea behind the design was to connect apples with its symbolic roots so I created a design which communicated divinity through its use of gold and white colors, Alphonse Mucha-like decorative swirls, and references to 15th century calligraphy.

In the front of the bottle, I laser cut a white label and at the back of each bottle is an image of houses tumbling and breaking into each other which plays on the idea of distortion usually caused by alcoholic drinks.

The backside of the bottle features monsters that were believed to have existed in the 15th century. These pictures were taken from a book called the Nuremberg Chronicle which contains the cumulative knowledge of what the people of Germany knew about the world.

All four bottles fit into a 4-pack soda box.

I created a pamphlet featuring all of the creatures from the Nuremburg Chronicle since every 4-pack contains only 4 bottles. (This pamphlet is slid into the 4-pack box.)

This photo displays all four parts of the 4-pack: the box, the bottle designs and the pamphlet.
