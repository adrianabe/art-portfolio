Mooscoop is a fictional brand of organic kid's yogurt that I created for my Identity and Symbols class. Most kid's yogurt packaging uses over-the-top and outdated motifs like surfing cows or animals with sunglasses. Even organic yogurt brands like Lifeway's Probug yogurt pouches uses excessive amounts of bright colors which could put off parents, thinking the yogurt is packed with sugar, from buying the yogurt for their kids.

In branding Mooscoop, I chose a bright color scheme that still suggests fruit but not so excessive that it would imply overly sugary. I did this by balancing areas of white space with color to suggest the smaller ratio of fruit to milk in the actual product.

<h1>Final Mooscoop Envelope, Business Letter, and Business Cards</h1>

<br>
At the inside of the envelope, is my mooscoop logo sitting in a diamond-shaped block of color. This block of color pours down into a pool of dripping yogurt, balancing the top of the envelope design.

<br>
The back of the business letter contains all the colors of my brand in a bright pattern over a dark background while the front of the letter contains only the logo and address for simplicity.

<br>
There are two sets of my business cards: one set uses cardboard with a laser cut design to show the brand's environmentally friendly aspect while the white version references the white envelope that the business letter came in. Each business card is the shape of a grocery paper bag and in each set of business cards is a 3d sticker.

<h1>Business Set Rough Drafts</h1>
![mooscoopdraft1]({{ "/assets/images/mooscoopdraft1.jpg" | relative_url }}){:class="full-width"}
In this draft, I combined three bright colors in a playful, dripping effect to reflect the yogurt the brand would sell.

This design focuses on a mature look with its monochromatic color scheme. The design wasn't chosen because its didn't communicate the dairy aspect of the brand.

![mooscoopdraft3]({{ "/assets/images/mooscoopdraft3.jpg" | relative_url }}){:class="full-width"}
This theme focuses on the organic aspect of the brand with its use of earthly colors and "organic" shapes.
